    <p>
      If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty
      quick, Chewie. We have you on our screen now. Please identify. Shuttle
      Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield. Shuttle
      Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage. Transmission
      commencing. Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid. It'll
      work. It'll work. Vader's on that ship. Now don't get jittery, Luke. There
      are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't
      look like you're trying to keep your distance. I don't know. Fly casual.
      I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come. It's your imagination,
      kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
