    <p>
      General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore. I'm sorry to hear that.
      Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, I'm a
      dead man. A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good
      fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you. Thank you, General.
